## Beyond the Lab

- 🎮 **Gamer at heart**  
  Passionate about story-rich open-world games like *The Witcher 3* and *Red Dead Redemption 2*. Not just playing—often thinking about narrative translation and cultural localization too!

- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling Enthusiast**  
  Over **2000 km** cycled across city and countryside routes. Bike = best form of mindfulness and local exploration.

- 🔧 **Hands-on Hobbyist**  
  Love fixing things—from squeaky doors to jammed espresso machines. If it's broken, there's a good chance I'll try to fix it before replacing it.

- 🌍 **Travel & Conferences**  
  While pursuing studies in Europe, I've visited multiple countries—sometimes for conferences, other times just to chase sunsets, architecture, and quiet bookstores. Check it out in my Google Map:
