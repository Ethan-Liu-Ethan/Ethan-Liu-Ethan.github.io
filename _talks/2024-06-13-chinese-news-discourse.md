**Abstract:**  
This presentation investigates the linguistic features of "Machine-Translationese" (MTese) in English-to-Chinese machine-translated news texts. Through machine learning approaches, we identify and quantify distinctive characteristics that differentiate machine-translated Chinese news texts from originally authored Chinese news texts. Our methodology employs clustering techniques to visualize these differentiating features, revealing systematic patterns in MTese.

**Key aspects:**  
- Comparative analysis of original vs. machine-translated Chinese news texts  
- Identification of quantifiable MTese markers in English-Chinese translation  
- Machine learning-based clustering for feature visualization  
- Implications for machine translation evaluation and quality assessment
