This study evaluates the performance of machine translations (MTs) versus human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. A Peter Pan corpus was constructed, including 21 translations: 7 HTs, 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis uses both a generic feature set (lexical, syntactic, readability, n-gram features) and a creative text translation (CTT-specific) feature set (repetition, rhythm, translatability, miscellaneous), totaling 447 linguistic features.

Stylometric analysis using classification and clustering techniques reveals that, for generic features, HTs and MTs differ significantly in conjunction word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang. NMTs and LLMs differ in descriptive word usage and adverb ratios. For CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution and align more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, highlighting the potential of LLMs in CLT.
