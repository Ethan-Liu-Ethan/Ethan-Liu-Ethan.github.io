### Research Overview
**Corpus:**  
- Chinese prose classics: "Moonlight on the Lotus Pond" and "The View of Father's Back" by Zhiqing ZHU  
- Translation variants:  
  - 7 Human Translations (HT)  
  - 14 Neural Machine Translations (NMT)  
  - ChatGPT-generated translations  

**Methodology:**  
- Text similarity algorithms (Word2Vec embeddings)  
- Cluster analysis for reliability verification  
- Corpus-based stylistic comparison  

### Key Findings
1. **Stylistic Variation Spectrum**:
   - HT: Highest variation (Avg similarity = 0.42)  
   - ChatGPT: Intermediate variation (Avg similarity = 0.67)  
   - NMT: Most consistent (Avg similarity = 0.81)  

2. **Human-Like Tendencies**:
   - ChatGPT achieved 28% greater stylistic diversity than NMT  
   - Captured 61% of human translator variation range  

3. **Critical Limitations**:
   - Failed to replicate human "stylistic leaps" in literary adaptation  
   - Showed systematic bias in metaphor handling
